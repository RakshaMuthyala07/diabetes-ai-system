        <p>Trained on <strong>768</strong> clinical cases</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Add your name below it:

```html
<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-top: 1rem; border-top: 1px solid var(--border);">

## ✅ Step 2: Take Screenshots (3 minutes)

1. **Open index.html** in your browser
2. **Take 3 screenshots:**

   **Screenshot 1: Dashboard**
   - Fill in some sample data
   - Click "Analyze Risk"
   - Capture the full screen showing results
   - Save as: `screenshots/dashboard.png`

   **Screenshot 2: Results Detail**
   - Scroll to show the risk gauge and chart
   - Capture this section clearly
   - Save as: `screenshots/results.png`

   **Screenshot 3: History Page**
   - Click "History" in sidebar
   - After you have a few predictions
   - Capture the history table
   - Save as: `screenshots/analytics.png`

3. **Update README.md** with screenshot paths:

```markdown
## 🚀 Demo

## ✅ Step 4: Customize the Design (Optional - 5 minutes)

Make the project visually YOURS by changing colors:

### Change Color Scheme

In `index.html`, find the `:root` section (around line 15) and modify:

```css
:root {
    /* Option 1: Blue/Teal (Current) */
    --primary: #0A4D68;
    --accent: #05C3DD;
    
    /* Option 2: Purple/Pink (Change to this) */
    /* --primary: #6B21A8;
    --accent: #EC4899; */
    
    /* Option 3: Green/Emerald */
    /* --primary: #065F46;
    --accent: #10B981; */
    
    /* Option 4: Orange/Red */
    /* --primary: #C2410C;
    --accent: #F97316; */
}
```

Uncomment one option and reload to see the change!

### Change Font (Optional)

Replace the font link in `<head>`:

```html
<!-- Current: Archivo -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Archivo:wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Option: Poppins (Modern) -->
<!-- <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> -->
```

Then update the CSS:
```css
body {
    font-family: 'Poppins', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
}
```

## ✅ Step 5: Test Everything (2 minutes)

Before uploading to GitHub, test:

- [ ] Open `index.html` - Does it load?
- [ ] Fill in a prediction - Does it work?
- [ ] Click all navigation items - Do they work?
- [ ] Try the "Download PDF" button - Does it download?
- [ ] Check the History page - Is data saved?
- [ ] Test on mobile (use browser dev tools)
- [ ] All screenshots taken and saved

---

## ✅ Step 6: Write Your Project Description (3 minutes)

When you upload to GitHub, you'll need a good description. Prepare it now:

### Repository Description (Short)
```
AI-powered diabetes risk prediction system with interactive dashboard, ML algorithms, and health recommendations. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js.
```

### LinkedIn Post (When Sharing)
```
